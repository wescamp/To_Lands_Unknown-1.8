Only the activation of the circle was needed for Summoners to leave this mortal world and enter the magical land of endless possibilities.
        In the Central Palace of Al-Kamija a great celebration began, during which the circle was going to be connected with the opened portal. The leaders of the Trinity and the chairmen of the Highest Council painted together the last segment and when it touched Abyss..."

        According to what Anthi had said, the only way to get into the Abyss was to set out to the west, to land of mysterious people who were known for making incredible things happen."

        story= _ "Two days later, a crewed ship awaited Mehir. Anthi explained that the country of those mysterious people was located in a high atitude and the only way to reach it is to fly. Mehir didn't fully understand what the highest priestess meant, but he boarded the ship with his soldiers and set out to another unknown land."

    [/part]
    [part]
        story= _ "And then Mehir understood what Anthi had in mind when she told him that it is impossible to reach this land by ship. Mehir saw a giant landmass above his head which stayed still in the air just over the clouds.
        Even flying carpets couldn't reach such a high atitude, so Mehir's people decided to draw a special circle on the ship's floor, similar to the one which was used by the Ka-Gattan Summoners centuries ago to travel between the surface and the underground. After few hours everything was ready and the first who had decided to teleport to the 'flying island' was Mehir."
