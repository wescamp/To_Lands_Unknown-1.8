        story= _ "A few weeks have passed before Mehir explored the palace of Tar-Tabar and met his servants. Under the supervision of old summoning veterans he has learnt how to use a Megacircle, a necessary spell for all true Summoner masters. He also learnt how to lead his troops in order to make his new army as effective as it was under Tashkar's command.
The mysterious messengers of death that have destroyed Mag-Magar haven't returned."

        story= _ "The construction of the Great Circle was continued. It was connected to the portal in Tar-Tabar, and three months later it has returned to the place where it was started - to Mag-Magar. A new stage of construction has begun: the cities of the Trinity were to be connected with Al-Kamija. Also, new, smaller circles were to be made. That time, construction was faster because of the thousands of workers from the capital.
Mehir, like the other leaders of the Trinity, was free to do as he wished, because the outer and biggest circle was finished. But there was still an opportunity to test his new skills in battle." 
    [/part]
    [part]
        story= _ "Few days ago one of the Efreeti revolted against his masters from Sud-Affar and fled to the Great Desert. It won't be anything special, for things like this happen in Al-Kamija once in a while, if not for the fact that this Efreet had convinced other magical creatures to follow him. Now, they wander through the desert and are a real threat to one of cities or even to the capital. Scouts have discovered the location of these corrupted beings. It turned out they are near Tar-Tabar, so Mehir was the one ordered to defeat them."
