[story]
    [part]
        story= _ "The army of the Dark Elves, as the Kharosans called them, was destroyed. Small groups of survivors retreated far away to the east, allowing people to return to their old lands. The conflict has stopped - for now."
    [/part]
    [part]
        story= _ "Meanwhile, Mehir was announced as the greatest hero of Kharos. While his scouts were searching for possible threats from the rest of the destroyed army, he spent a lot of time with Anthi, getting to know the Kharosan culture and the history of the Ancestral Lands.
During his visit Mehir learnt many things about the Kharosans and their religion. The Kharosans worship the Sun as God and the light as the source of life. This specific dualism reflects in their social structure. The Kharosan society is ruled by wise priestesses of the cult of light which are adept in magic and use it without drawing circles. The army and all connected services are subordinated to the so-called sun warriors."
    [/part]
    [part]
        story= _ "The Kharosans know magic, but it is not the summoning one used by the Summoners. The  Priestesses of Light, are the only ones in their society who know how to use it. Often called white magic, it comes from the energy of the Sun, a fact that greatly surprised the Summoners. To them, magic always has come from the Abyss. The Priestesses can control the power of the light using their minds. Mehir noted that the Darkblooded, Dark Elves and  the mysterious flying mage, Aerius, were also using this weird technique of spellcasting."
    [/part]
    [part]
        story= _ "In the meantime, the messenger sent by Mehir reached Al-Kamija after a week and gave the sensational message about Rashti turning into her true form. The Highest Council discovered that the death of Rashti, her egos' resurrection and their integration into a female form of Nomolas has completely destroyed the balance between worlds, causing the Great Circle to be outdated, like the current 'address' of the Abyss. However, the experiments carried out by their ancestors showed that fluctuations of time in multi-world space would delay the reactions of actions that took place for 13 days. The messenger traveled for 7 days, which meant that the Summoners had six days to finish the circle in it's current form and move to the Abyss. If it won't make it on time, the whole work will be wasted."
    [/part]
    [part]
        story= _ "In order to increase the building speed of the Great Circle in its current form the Highest Council ordered all citizens of the Summoner country to assist the builders. Women, children, even elders -  a few millions of people joined the workers. The messenger  immediately set out to Mehir to tell him these important news."
