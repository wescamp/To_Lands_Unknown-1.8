        story= _ "Among a miriad of dunes, in the center of our Holy Land, an unreal palace-city lies - our capital Al-Kamija.
It is an unusual place. It is not damaged by destructive influances of time and sand. The Sun doesn't burn it's walls, because they're always cool. There is no short of any goods, because everything is found here.

How is this possible?"

        story= _ "A long time ago, when our ancestors lived on the outskirts of the desert, they made an extremely powerful discovery - Magic. Hidden in the form of magical formulas and symbols, magic controlled our fate.
   The Ancestors discovered the Abyss - another world full of energy, where time and space have no meaning. Our entire arsenal of known magic comes from the Abyss. We can summon this power to our world - and that's the reason we are called Summoners."

    [part]
        story= _ "At the beginning, the Ancestors believed that the Abyss was  a place of primitive chaos - until they summoned the first magical being, a true dweller of that different world. It was Nomolas, the first jinn.
Unrestrained by imagination, this entity is the most powerful being we know to this day. Theoretically, Nomolas is capable of destroying even a God.
The ancestors managed to communicate with Nomolas, who turned out to be obedient like all summoned magical entities."
    [/part]
    [part]
        story= _ "There was no wish that Nomolas couldn't fulfil. To measure his potential the Ancestors wished for the most beautiful city in the world, to be located in the middle of the desert, that would become their new home, the capital of their land. In a few moments, Nomolas created Al-Kamija from thin air.

Since then, a few centuries have passed. Nomolas rested in the central palace, waiting for another call. We try to use him only if there is no other choice. Other magical entities summoned after Nomolas weren't as powerful as he, although their power is still impressive and is completely sufficient for our needs."

    [part]
        story= _ "Living in Al-Kamija, we have learned quite a lot about Abyss, but we haven't been able to enter that world. Maybe because no-one in that dimension can summon us... However, in the last few years, we managed to design a special magic circle that is able to take us to that unreal world. Our tests were successful, but to this day we cannot summon previously sent items back to our world. As a result of this, although it sounds crazy, we decided to send our entire land to the Abyss, hoping that we will find the solution on the other side. But even if we find it, we may not use it...
        
It should be stressed that we believe we will find in the Abyss the ultimate sense of our life and decide to stay there forever."
    [/part]
    [part]
        story= _ "We designed a giant circle, one that will include most of our land. The circle is 2000 kms in diameter, so we built three cities, each separated from one another by exactly the same distance to make the construction easier. The leaders of Mag-Magar, Tar-Tabar and Sud-Affar will supervise the works by their assistants."

        story= _ "  This campaign tells the story of Mehir, a young summoner, who will play a very important role in the history of the Era of Magic. But before it happens, he will have to prove his strength by advancing in a complex hierarchy of Summoners.
At this point, Mehir has been appointed as a Sharif's assistant, the leader of Sud-Affar, the south city of the Trinity. He was immediately sent to the east, to supervise the building of the circle, just outside the territory of Mag-Magar."
